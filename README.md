"# Midterm-Portfolio" 
Creating a static portfolio using HTML and CSS
This midterm is designed in a way that is similar to assignment 1, in terms of the use of
different HTML elements and CSS selectors. The goal of this examination is for you to
practice more the use of CSS to style HTML contents.
In this exam, you are asked to create a portfolio using proper HTML and CSS. A portfolio
is like an introduction page, a collection of work samples that you can post online. Having
a portfolio can help you in job interviews. You can use this project as a basis to present
yourself better for future opportunities.
Like Assignment 1, your page has to be fully static, using only CSS and HTML. The use
of CSS to style your websites in a way that it’s appealing to the user is very important.

Your page should include:
- Your name, occupation, …
- An avatar
- A short blurb to introduce you to your visitors (bio)
- A button to view/access your resume/cv (this button should be working, meaning
when clicked, it should either show or download the resume on user’s computer)
- A short demonstration of your skills and abilities (using text, images, ...)
- Links to social media on which you are active.
- Your contact information (just email would suffice)
- A contact me form (does not need to work, only the design)
Pay attention:
● If you do not have enough work experience to populate your page with, you can
mention the projects of important courses you worked on during your studies.
● Your page should be fully static, meaning that the functionalities are not yet
implemented, but the design should be complete.
● In creating your website, you might need to use more HTML elements and CSS
properties than explained in the lectures. You can use your textbook or w3schools
to learn more about them.
● You should layout your content using <div> tags and position them as you see fit.
The number of columns and the exact layout is up to you.
● Proper implementation of the tags and contents is very important. Think about
exceptional cases when the pictures cannot be loaded, etc.
